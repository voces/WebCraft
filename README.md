This is a recreation of a WarCraft III game called Bulldog Excursion, which itself is a mix-up on
[Sheep Tag](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sheep+tag). The original goal was to get the base game working, which has been
completed. Now the goal is to make the game 1) acceptable to the old Bulldog community and 2) playable at-large as a .io game.
