# WebCraft
**HTML5 game engine**

The goal of this project is to create an easy to use, unified game engine. While sticking to OOP, the philosophy of the engine is modeled after WarCraft III. The style is modeled after three.js, which itself is the primary graphics library.

The ideal is for most games to have a single codebase that will handle both the client and server, handling all networking and state synchronization as transparently as possbile.
